# Valorant Stats Analyzer

**Valorant Stats Analyzer** is a web-based application designed to help players analyze their personal performance in Valorant using Riot's official APIs and RSO (Riot Sign-On) authentication.

The app will allow users to securely log in with their Riot account and visualize detailed statistics from their recent matches. The goal is to help players track their progress, identify patterns in their gameplay, and improve over time.
