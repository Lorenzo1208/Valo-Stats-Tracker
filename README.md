# Valo-Stats-Tracker# Valorant Personal Stats Tracker

This is a personal project using Riot's API to track my own Valorant match statistics.

It will display:
- My kills / deaths per match
- Agents played
- Maps played
- Where I tend to die on the map
- What agents I perform best with

The app will use Riot's RSO OAuth2 to authenticate and access `/accounts/me` and `VAL-MATCH-V1` endpoints.

⚠️ This is a personal, private project. Not intended for public use.
